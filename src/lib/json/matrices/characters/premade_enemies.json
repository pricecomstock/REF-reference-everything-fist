When a character is dealt 6 or more DAMAGE by a sewer beast, there is a 1-in-1D6 chance they will begin to spontaneously, gruelingly develop a new, random trait (p. 39-66)."

Unbeknownst to their original engineers, these parasites exhibit odd contagious behavior that encourages infected victims to converge on one spot and fuse. If a PC's skin is exposed to the pathogen, they must roll to resist this parasitic compulsion.",
	  "ABSORB (BOSS MOVE): When hurt, the writhing mass of flesh may try to absorb a FIST operative in a bid to bulk up its biomass. When this move is activated, the writhing mass's next attack will be against the most-injured PC. If it kills them, the mass heals equal to their max HP."
