TRAIT: description
* item, stat modifier
[AUTHOR: name]
________________


5IREPROOF: The number 5 personally despises you, and the feeling is mutual. If the total of your roll is exactly 5, you may roll again and take the first result that isn’t a !@#$ 5. If the total of your roll is exactly 10, do the same, because a 10 is just two 5s in a trenchcoat.
* Bottle of 50 proof vodka (+1D6 HP, reroll on 5s), +2 CREATIVE
[AUTHOR: Brandoff]
________________


6TH SENSE: You tend to feel when danger is nearby. You can dodge slow projectiles (grenades, rockets, rocks, etc) without rolling the dice. Once per mission you can dodge a faster projectile (bullets, lasers, etc) without rolling the dice.
* Overcoat (1 ARMOR), +2 REFLEXIVE
[AUTHOR: Sea47r]

________________

ABOMINABLE: You’re an experiment gone horrifically wrong (or horrifically right) that can change between a humanoid and monstrous form. Describe your monstrous identity and roll 1D6 to determine your CHOKE score for PEEP THE HORROR. Whenever you PEEP THE HORROR, your true form is revealed and your stats are modified as follows: Max HP is multiplied by 1.5 rounded down, ARMOR starts at 0 but may be increased by spending WAR DICE (or eating your teammates), and DAMAGE equals 1D6+ your number of character traits. While in your monstrous form you’re not exactly in full control, and the other players and the referee will decide on something irrational you must do before the scene ends. You revert back to your humanoid form at the end of the scene.
* Stress ball (allows you to ignore transformation, one use), +1 to chosen attribute
[AUTHOR: Groov]

________________

ABSORB: You have a highly advanced suit that can redirect kinetic energy. Whenever you take damage, even if nullified by ARMOR, mark a triangle on your sheet. When you hit a target with a melee attack, you may consume your triangles to add that much to your attack's damage.
* K.A.M. suit (1 ARMOR), +1 TACTICAL
[AUTHOR: Gunzales]
________________


ACCEPTANCE: It doesn't matter what they say, your belief never wanes. For without love, it cannot be seen. Choose a concept or ideal to believe in that can be summarized within a sentence (for example: "Redemption is always possible.", "Magic is never fake." or "I am a witch!"). You will always believe in this mantra and your faith will never falter. Anything which would challenge or apply to your mantra will always end in the favor of your belief.
* Your best friend (a stuffed animal, it is as alive as you believe it to be), +1 CREATIVE
[AUTHOR: noelle144p]
________________


ACCESSORY: your consciousness is tied to a wearable accessory. Whenever something wears the accessory, alive or dead, your consciousness inhabits it. living things that do this have their own consciousness immediately destroyed, and removing the accessory from a living thing that you are inhabiting effectively kills it. when you inhabit a new body, work with the referee to determine what your new stats, traits, and inventory look like. any traits or stats you obtain through character creation and advancement are intrinsically tied to you, and manifest on anything you inhabit.
* Your choice (1 ARMOR, accessory), -2 MAX HP
[AUTHOR: ululu]
________________


ACROBAT: You can do feats of acrobatics, such as backflipping or diving over a barrier, without rolling the dice. If it’s something particularly difficult, such as doing cartwheels to avoid machine gun fire or diving through the crevice of falling rocks, you do so, but you’ll be rattled - the next time you would take DAMAGE, double it.
* Black trench coat (1 ARMOR), +1 RFX
[AUTHOR: Groov]
________________


ACROBAT: You can tumble and twirl through the air with ease, crossing great gaps, rising to greater heights, without rolling. If attacked while navigating an exceptional height (flipping off a cliff onto a moving train, swinging across a suspension bridge, you always stick the landing but injure yourself in the process. Roll +REFLEXIVE to see the severity of the injury.
* Baston (1D6 DAMAGE) +1 REFLEXIVE
[AUTHOR: christron5000]

________________
ACME: Up to three times per mission, you can get any base weapon or gadget mentioned in the FIST Ultra rulebook delivered to your location in 30 seconds by using a communications device - any communications device. However, use of that weapon or gadget always requires a roll, and any roll of 7+ with it is always a partial success, never full or ultra success. Rolling a failure comically explodes the object without doing you any harm. Once per mission, you can paint a tunnel on a surface and go through it. Nobody can follow you - it's a painting, remember?
* ?, +2 CREATIVE, -2 TACTICAL
[AUTHOR: Duckie]
________________

ADAPTABILITY: You have raised various attributes to ensure your survival, increasing your agility and resistances. You can always find the time to use items quickly in a fight.

[AUTHOR: eat grass fool]
________________


AERO: With a deep breath, you can inflate the helium sacs surgically implanted throughout your body and float up to a maximum of 20ft for as long as you can hold your breath. You’re very popular at parties. Being an airhead (literally) also makes you less susceptible to mind control by the simple fact that there’s just less mind there to control.
* Leather flight suit (1 ARMOR), +1 TACTICAL
[AUTHOR: ghostlenin]
________________


A.I.: you have an artificial intelligence implant in your brain, providing crucial intel on the fly, roll +TACTICAL when utilizing this information. It also has a primary function, pick a trait it excels in with the relevant gear but not the associated attributes.

[AUTHOR: ?]
________________

* Confusing backstory (+1 per role on rolls made to distract someone), -1 TACTICAL
[AUTHOR: dilbee]
________________


ANIME: You’re a living anime character, with a striking art style to match. When you take this trait, declare the genre of anime you’re part of (such as mecha, shonen, slice of life, etc).

When you roll to do something risky that defies a cliche from your genre, roll 3D6 and keep the worst two.

[AUTHOR: ClassicJ]

ANTAGONIST: The story has deemed you important. You are a force of misfortune, a thorn in the side of the ‘heroes’ of the world. You can spend WAR DICE to subtract from a roll rather than add to it—but the minimum result must still be 1.
* Worn-out teddy bear (destroy to gain 1D6 WAR DICE), +1 CREATIVE
[AUTHOR: dilbee]
________________


ANTIMEMETIC: You emanate an anti-psychic field that causes physical pain to everyone around you. Most people will experience mild headaches in your presence, and your mind cannot be read by psychics. In addition, you may attempt to overload the mind of one person with this field and cause their head to explode by rolling +TACTICAL. If you fail this roll, your head explodes instead.
* Psychic inhibitor (prevents head explosion, one use), -2 CREATIVE
[AUTHOR: Groov]
________________


ANTI-MIDAS: You've got money to burn, quite literally. Coins, bills, credit cards, cheques, gems, precious metals, or any other form of abstract worth gives off a dull throbbing pain at your touch. You may obliterate any of these (by throwing, touching, crushing, or staring) to create force equal to its abstract value, as determined by the GM. A quarter is about equivalent to a gunshot, whereas a loaded credit card is closer to several tons of tnt.
* Roll of pennies, +1 TACTICAL
[AUTHOR: Ann/Dr Wizard]
________________


ANTIQUARIAN: You’re a seasoned treasure hunter and know just where to find the strange and novel. Once per mission, you may ask the referee for a hint as to where a collectible can be found.

*   Hardhat (1 ARMOR, accessory), -1 CREATIVE
[AUTHOR: Groov] 
________________


ARCHER: You have an inexplicably, inexhaustible quiver of trick arrows that produce non-lethal and environmental effects (e.g., snare someone in a net, shrink a vehicle and everyone inside). With a successful attack roll describe what the effect is in lieu of dealing damage.

[AUTHOR: ClassicJ] 
________________


ARITHMANCER: When you roll for a risky action, you may choose to multiply the dice values instead of adding them to determine the total value. Your next roll for a risky action may not utilize this TRAIT and suffers a -1 penalty:

[AUTHOR: magic badger]

________________

ASTHMA: You have a customized inhaler that gives you a boost of strength when you use it. Choose one of the following for whenever you use your inhaler: 1). +2 to the next attribute you roll, 2). +2 ARMOR the next time you would take DAMAGE, or 3). Immunity to the next breathing based effect you would suffer. If you roll the dice to do something risky involving stamina and endurance and you don’t have your inhaler, roll 3D6 and take the worst two. When you advance, you may choose to take another bonus for using your inhaler instead of taking one of the usual advancement rewards.
  -    Kitted out inhaler (6 uses), +1 REFLEXIVE
[AUTHOR: Groov]
________________


AUDACITY: Confidence allows all kinds of things that wouldn't be possible otherwise. Make all checks in secret. The Referee can demand to see the hidden roll - if it matches what you claimed, gain a +1 to your next roll. If you were lying then all the karma your bluster has sidestepped comes crashing down at once and a crazy-unlikely event occurs, doing 3D6 damage. 
* Confusing business card (STUN conversational target, one use), +1 TACTICAL
[AUTHOR : E5Burrito]

________________

AUTHORITY: You exude authority, and the lowest-ranking members of any hierarchy are eager to win your approval.  At any time, you can raise your badge at any non-boss NPC and roll FRC, choosing two of the following on a success, or one on a partial success:
- They drop an item from their inventory
- They must make a Choke roll (pg. 90)
- They leave you alone and stop asking questions
- They answer two questions as honestly as possible
Regardless of success, after you show someone the badge, that person cannot be affected by this trait again for the rest of the mission.

* Bus fare to any location (one use), +1D6 WAR DICE
[AUTHOR: ClassicJ]

BACKGROUND: You have a way of blending in with the scenery. When lying or bluffing to convince rank-and-file people (e.g. CYCLOPS grunts or privates in a hostile army) that you’re supposed to be where you are, roll 3 dice and keep the highest two. Additionally, once per mission when the ref narrates a scene without you in it, you may declare that you’re actually there unnoticed. If it’s particularly improbable that you’d be in a given situation, there will be a complication- the ref will tell you what.

[AUTHOR: maenad of miami]
________________


BEHOLDER: There’s a certain kind of beauty in your eyes that leaves your audience utterly enthralled. Once per session, you may activate your powerful glare.

If you have more ones than zeros, your next roll becomes an OMEGA SUCCESS, a success that can turn the tables in even the most dire of situations. If you have more zeros than ones, your next roll will become an OMEGA FAILURE, which can absolutely ruin even the most perfectly executed plans.

________________


BUTTERFLY: It’s funny how things work out. Once per mission, you can choose to have an extraordinarily unlikely set of circumstances or coincidences resolve any one challenge, obstacle, or situation--within reason--that you are personally involved in. Afterwards, the referee will tell you what you need to do in the past to make sure these circumstances arise; the greater the magnitude of the resolution, the more difficult the setup becomes. Failure to do so will result in a time paradox and the subsequent erasure of your personal timeline as time repairs itself.
* Curious stopwatch (use to set up circumstances, one use), -2 CREATIVE
[AUTHOR: Witch]
________________


BUTTERFLY: You see the world in never-ending strings of cause and effect, and possess the ability to nudge fate in your favor. You may observe any event or object and get a rough estimate of how it might influence the future without your intervention. Additionally, once per mission, you may twist fate in a situation by stating what immediate future you want to nullify, such as stopping a bullet from killing a friend or stalling the villain's kill-switch. Note that your intervention will still cause a new butterfly effect to occur, of which the nature of this new future is decided by the referee.

CALCULUS: You are able to predict what physical moves the people around you are about to make. So long as you are able to observe a subject, they can never make a physical move that surprises you, and you can tell if their reaction to threats will be to flee, back down, fight back, use lethal force, etc. Once per mission, when the referee narrates that a character makes a move, you can interrupt their action with a move of your own, which happens almost instantly and takes priority over their action. You can use this ability additional times per mission by spending a War Dice each time.

All allies who noticed you taking that damage get +1 to their next roll to avoid damage from the same source.

CAPED CRUSADER: You are an icon of the night, your name feared by those who hide in the shadows. Whenever rumors of your presence in the area are spread, your enemies will fear your arrival and cower at the sight of you. Additionally, once per mission, you can make a dramatic entrance into a room full of people and cause all unnamed characters to flee the area.
* Night-black cape (always billowing), +1 DAMAGE against unnamed characters

CAPTURE: You are skilled at capturing, taming, training, and battling with all sorts of creatures. You can throw a Capture Capsule to attempt to capture a creature or entity. These captures have an X-in-D6 chance to resist, where X is their remaining HP. Successful captures are added to your inventory, and can be summoned and recalled at will to aid you. Captures will obey your commands, but largely retain their free will, so powerful ones may require training, and ones with arguable personhood will fail to capture entirely. If a capture reaches 0 HP, it is lost for good.
* Capture Capsules (3 uses), -2 DAMAGE with all weapons

CASSANDRA: You've developed an uncanny knack for anticipating the future. Once per session you may ask for a vision and the referee will give you a kaleidoscopic series of images and impressions as an answer. The vision will pertain to your mission, but may be difficult to interpret.

CARDS: You love a contest of fate, maybe a little too much. Your stats are irrelevant. At the start of each mission draw 4 cards from a deck of cards face down and assign each to a stat, then decide which two stats shall be negative. Upon rolling the Dice with a stat, reveal the card associated, your stat bonus shall be the value of the card divided by 2, rounded up. Aces low, face cards count as 0. Cards must be shuffled by the referee prior to drawing cards.

CAUSAL: You know how this is all going to end. Once per mission upon rolling a failure, you may declare that the dice are breaking the timeline that you know is supposed to happen and force a scene to play out in the way the players vote on, essentially forcing a cutscene. After doing so, you suffer psychic exhaustion from stabilizing the timeline and take -2 to every roll until the end of the mission.

CENSORED: You just can’t seem to ****ing express yourself. Your attacks can never kill their targets or cause gory effects like limb loss, instead miraculously knocking enemies out if your damage would reduce them to 0 HP. You’re also incapable of swearing, using drugs, and similarly censorship-worthy actions (For any determined during play, mark them down somewhere on your sheet). However, once per mission you may censor something grim, violent or otherwise objectionable and shift reality to fit the change (for example, an ally’s gruesome death by a monster might instead result in their capture, or a stockpile of chemical weapons might become glitter
bombs).

CEO: You are a flesh automaton animated by neurotransmitters. Due to a lucrative deal with a corporate death squad, you are capable of using their state-of-the-art resurrection systems. When you die during a mission, keep this character and choose to either revive them at the start of the next mission or liquidate them to pay off your corporate debt. However, they expect you to do intern work in exchange for using this tech. Your role is irrelevant, and you can only advance by completing your contract - You're a gig economy assassin now, so you've gotta kill someone during the mission.

COINSHOT: You can ricochet bullets off of coins to deal massive damage to your foes. At the beginning of the mission you gain 4 coins that you may toss into the air at any time; roll +REFLEXIVE to shoot the coin flying in the air. If the roll succeeds, the bullet will ricochet towards the nearest enemy and deal an extra 2 DAMAGE and ignore ARMOR. If you ricochet a bullet off of multiple coins, the damage bonus doubles (2 becomes 4, 4 becomes 8, etc.), but you take a cumulative -1 to your REFLEXIVE for every coin used. You gain a coin on a full success and can instantly gain 4 more by spending a WAR DIE.

COLLECTOR: You have a cursed sword that gives you great power in exchange for the taking of heads in its name. Whenever you kill an enemy with 6 or more HP that has a head using this weapon, you gain +1 MAX HP and +1 DAMAGE for this weapon. The more heads you collect, the more you will be compelled to try and collect the heads of your own allies- at the beginning of a mission, if you have at least 3 heads, roll3D6. If you roll equal to or below your number of collected heads, your role becomes irrelevant and your will is subsumed by the sword - the only way you may advance is by collecting the head of an ally. Your role returns after completing the mission.

COMBO: You are the pinnacle of combat! Every time you make a unique attack against an enemy, add +1 to your attack rolls. This bonus accumulates until your attacks become bland and samey, in which case this bonus returns to 0. If you roll a failure while performing a combo, the next instance of DAMAGE you take adds your cumulative bonus to it. Additionally, you do not need to take time to swap between weapons.
* Red trench coat (1 ARMOR, smokin’ sexy style), +1 FORCEFUL
[AUTHOR: Groov]
________________


COMBO: Your power grows as you display your mastery. You have a combo meter starting at level 1- note it somewhere on your sheet. When you take this trait, pick another trait you don’t have- note it down as your COMBO TRAIT, and work out a major improvement for it with the ref. Your combo meter has the following levels:


1: Deal -1 DAMAGE, -1 ARMOR
2: -1 ARMOR
3: Deal +1 DAMAGE
4: Deal +2 DAMAGE, +1 ARMOR
5: Deal +3 DAMAGE, +1 ARMOR, +1 to your highest stat
6: Deal +4 DAMAGE, +2 ARMOR, +1 to your highest stat, gain your COMBO TRAIT


When you make a roll that doesn’t repeat anything you did in the last two rolls (like attacking with the same weapon twice, repeating a tactic, or utilizing a trait twice) and it’s at least a partial success, increase your combo meter by 1 and gain the appropriate benefit or drawback. Decrease it by 1 on a failure and reset it to 1 on two consecutive failures, resting at a rendezvous point, or at the end of the mission.

CONTRARIAN: It's your life's purpose to argue, to be the devil's advocate, and the devil has granted you reality-shifting powers. When the referee says "no" to another player, you say "yes", and when the referee says "yes", you say "no". For each, once per session, your interruption can supercede the referee, and reality shifts appropriately. Your dice rolls are inverted. Snake Eyes (double 1) is an Ultra Success, 4 and under a success, 5-7 partial success, 8+ fail.

CONTAGION: You have an anomalous infection. If you gained this trait on character creation or as an advance, you’re a carrier and must randomly roll another trait as well. That trait is the infection’s symptom, and you’re encouraged to come up with a name for the condition after determining it. When you make skin-to-skin contact using your contagious touch, roll 1D6 and apply the corresponding effect: 


1: Give the target CONTAGION and its symptom (but not the symptom’s associated item or stat bonus). 
2-4: The target is briefly stunned by a physiological response such as intense coughing or sneezing. 
5-6: Halve the target’s health, rounding up. 


Cures for CONTAGION may become available in the world at the ref’s discretion, but a character can only be cured of this trait or exhibit its symptom if they’re not a carrier.

CONVERTER: Whenever you spend a WAR DIE, you can instead use a METRIC WAR DIE for a guaranteed +3 instead of rolling 1D6. Additionally, whenever a measurement of something is given, found or described in either Metric or Imperial units, you can instantly convert whatever that something is to the same number or figure, but in the other measurement system. Shorten that 10 metre mecha to 10 feet! Swap out room temperature for below freezing!

You always know if an enemy has BOSS MOVES, and what they

You may never take items off of defeated foes, and you cannot
attack anything that is unaware of your presence.
Your covenant items are Sol Medallions. These are created when

DEMOLITIONIST: the age old proverb of "modern problems require modern solutions" applies perhaps the most relevantly to plastic explosives. You can always rig traps or arm/Disarm explosives without rolling the dice. however you must roll +TACTICAL if working under pressure.

DEMON: Foul scion of the night on the run from The Elder, you’ve taken on a mostly-human form.

DENIAL: It doesn't matter what they say, you insist that you know it is not real.  It's useless, it's all useless! Choose one single word concept (for example: ghosts, magic, love, witches), you either are unaware, ignorant or deny the existence of this concept. Anything which aligns with your denied concept does not exist for you, both you and the denied force cannot perceive nor affect each other.

DEVELOPER: You’re a poor code monkey working on this new game called FIST, and you have administrative rights to deal with inconsistencies in the code and eradicate bugs. Once per session, if you have a completely silent and safe moment, you may manifest the developer’s console and change a variable of something, such as tweaking an enemy type’s HP to 1, or add a “if then” statement, such as“IfFACTION=CIA thenBODY=COMBUSTS.” Keep in mind that you’re only here to work on this game until full release starts, and if the referee feels that your changes are sufficient, you will lose administrative permissions, spelling your end as a playable character.

DISBELIEF: Undead warriors in power armor fighting alien squid monsters shooting mind bullets and all that one guy’s got is a bow and arrow? None of it makes a lick of sense, and that annoys you. You can suppress the paranormal, provided you concentrate and think about nothing else but how ridiculous everything is. Once per session you negate the effects of another Trait or an environmental effect. While doing so, you make all rolls with 3D6 and take the two lowest results.

DISCREPANCY: You mathematically shouldn’t exist. Once per mission, you may increase the numbers shown on the dice by one (e.g. a five and two to a six and three). However, your violation of the laws of probability will create an anomalous effect on the area around you. The referee will decide what that is. If you were to increase a six to a seven, you pop out of existence and correct the universe. If you increase two sixes to sevens, you and everyone nearby are transported to the Court of Mathematical Justice.

ELF: You can see in dim light as if it were daylight, but daylight doesn't do the old school night vision goggles blindness deal. A partial success to find a hidden door is treated as a full success. You live hundreds of years, it never really comes up and no one remembers so it doesn't affect anything. Dwarven bromance is an inevitability.

ERASE: If you wish hard enough, all your problems will disappear - literally. Up to three times per mission, you can cause a nonliving thing to be removed from all existence.

FRONTMAN: Among your bandmates, you’re the decider of arguments (for better or worse) and the face of the group. it’s not so much that what you say goes, but you do act as a one-person plurality of opinion. you’re the one most fans and rock reporters want to talk to, and you’ve honed your gift of gab. whenever you’re talking to someone with a positive attitude towards you, you can hold their attention for as long as you wish.

FROZEN SOUL: The spirit of Winter stemming from your soul causes you to exude a glacial aura around you, covering yourself with a layer of magical, protective ice. As long as your aura is present, you have -2 REFLEXIVE and +2 ARMOR, though the aura itself isn’t armor, and only applies if you aren’t equipping any armor. However, damage you take from fire ignores the armor bonus. Once per mission, you may sacrifice your aura to nullify all non-fire damage dealt towards you in a single instance, shattering the layer of protective ice, and losing all benefits and drawbacks of the aura. You regain your aura at the beginning of your next mission.

Your body exists across the entire electromagnetic spectrum: from radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light, x-rays, to gamma rays. In your fully manifested form you appear as a blindingly bright figure, cause extreme interference with technology around you, and are dangerous to be near for most life. However, you are fully capable of controlling which wavelengths you exist on and filtering between them at will for as long as your fractal prism is intact. 
Once per mission, you can shoot a beam or touch a target to deliver concentrated electromagnetism of any wavelength, that does 3D6 Damage to anyone caught in it. depending on its frequency this beam may have other relevant effects at the group's discretion.

GESTALT: You are greater than the sum of your parts. When you take this trait, it replicates one other trait you already have, including all of that trait's unique quirks, abilities, inventory items and ability boosts. Any "once per mission" ability that trait confers consequently becomes "twice per mission"; extrapolate additional quirks as necessary. While functionally replicating that trait, GESTALT is still GESTALT and can't be taken again.

If dealing with people who would recognize you without the glamour, or maintaining it for extended periods of time (long/multiple scenes), you must spend a war die to really lay it on thick.

On a partial, the referee only tells you what the enemies will do. On a failure, you see nothing.

You may then use the result rolled to do one of the following: a) add to a roll to do something risky as you would with a WAR DIE, b) heal another character for HP equal to the result, or c) invoke spontaneous haemorrhaging within a single target, dealing instant damage equal to the result, ignoring armor, without needing to make an attack roll.

INSUFFERABLE: You are an insidious bore who doesn't know how to have fun playing a tabletop game other than D&D's fifth edition; you insist on dragging everything out and claim you don't understand how to be a FIST operative because it's "all too complicated". Once per session, you can summon a dread gazebo to attack everyone in sight. Additionally, you can Hide at any time, even if there's nothing to hide behind, because that's how you've decided the Stealth rules work, and demand the referee make a perception check. The referee will not do this.

Once per mission, you may declare a single statement no longer than six words. If it is false, you take damage proportional to the magnitude of the lie deemed appropriate by the Referee (e.g. white lie - 1 DAMAGE, contradict the laws of physics - 6+ DAMAGE), and the statement becomes true.

Upon dying, you may be reincarnated at any time by the way of a dream ritual performed by willing participants; the nature of this ritual is determined by the referee. You cannot pick traits that would contradict the nature of your archetype, such as an  honorable warrior using subterfuge and lies to win, unless you can provide a valid reason for taking it (e.x. referring to a real world mythological or historical figure).

Your body stores the kinetic energy you receive from impacts, and releases it in your unarmed attacks. Damage you take from all impacts (fists, bullets, cars, etc.) is halved, and can never reduce your HP below 1. Whenever you take damage from an impact, you may add that much damage to the next unarmed attack you make in the same scene. If you end a scene with damage stored, you must make an attack to release it immediately or take damage equal to what you have stored as kinetic energy rebounds within yourself.

When you do, come up with a snappy acronym with 3 to 5 letters (e.g. EXO, BLAST, STING, BURN etc). The next attack the loaded weapon makes has additional properties based on the words in the ammo’s acronym (e.g a TSAR round with “Target Scanning Aerial Reconnaissance” as its words could show you the location of a hidden airborne enemy).

Partial successes means an element of the spell is different from what you wanted, but this isn’t always bad. Full success does what is expected and 12’s means the spell has additional positive effects. Spells can only be used once per mission.

MARK: You leave an impression on your foes, which in turn makes them want to kill you even more when you would deal fatal DAMAGE to an enemy, you may instead leave your mark on them, such as a scar across the eye or a missing finger, and have them retreat from the mission area. Every time you leave your mark on someone, you gain either 1D6 MAX HP, +1 to an attribute of your choice, or 1D6 WAR DICE. However, your humiliated enemy is going to want payback, and they’ll gain new strength from their hatred of you. These nemeses gain double their MAX HP, +1 ARMOR, and an appropriate trait-like ability; this bonus becomes exponential for every 4 nemeses you create (4 nemeses makes the bonus triple their MAX HP, +2 ARMOR, and two traits, 8 makes the bonus quadruple their MAX HP, +3 ARMOR, and three traits, etc.). Your bonus for humiliating enemies increases alongside nemesis strength in a similar fashion. Before the beginning of a mission, roll 1D6; if you roll equal to or below the amount of nemeses you have, one is guaranteed to appear in the mission.

With a reasonable amount of prep time, you can also treat a corpse with your embalming toolkit and do one of the following: 1) repair and fortify it, granting it +2 MAX HP if it rises from the dead. It is considered fresh for a week for all purposes of traits requiring a fresh corpse; or 2) give proper funerary rites to it, preventing it from rising from the dead. Once per session, if you perform this to give a proper send off a dead comrade, you gain +1 WAR DIE.

MOTH: Between real and unreal, factual and conspiratorial, mystery flutters on dark wings. When investigating a scene or searching for clues, you may roll +CRE to perform a leap in logic. On a success, you're able to garner useful information about a scene from mere scraps. On a failure, the Moth takes delight in the mystery, and an impossible wrinkle (ex. cryptids, double identities, aliens) becomes temporarily true, making the situation worse. Your role is irrelevant- advance at the end of a mission if you put yourself in danger chasing a secret, mystery, or truth.

MOTLEY: Nothing about you is cohesive. you seem to be made of multiple different, competing components that are barely held together by solid stitching and sheer force of will. it is hard for you to speak in coherent sentences. When you roll the minimum on a damage roll, roll 2D6: choose 1 of those dice to deal as damage and the other to regain that much HP.

MYCELIAL: You've always preferred the underbelly of things, darker and removed from the rest of the world — and now, some of the dark underbelly is in you. You have a fungal infestation, a parasite to be frank; but it's not all bad — some nutrients here and there, a chunk of your skull or chest cavity taken up by mushroom (internally! Probably...), and you get some nice benefits. Like tendrils that can connect to the recently dead, letting you once per scene examine through someone's memories, and discover information that they knew (the clarity of information dependent on how 'fresh' the body is).

You are capable of communicating with colonies of any type of fungus; they will be able to answer any question as long as they could reasonably do so (e.g. describing a vibration they felt, what they have eaten recently, or a nearby person that carries a fungal infection). Additionally, once per mission, you may unleash a cloud of spores from your body that will irritate and inflame flesh, causing most biological entities to flee from you.

NANO-INFUSED
You have been infused with an experimental injection of nanomachines, upgrading your body's natural processes. 
When you concentrate, you can monitor your health & bodily functions and identify any factors currently affecting them.
When you take this trait, pick two parts of your body or bodily processes to become augmented. (Lungs, Eyes, Digestion, Healing, etc.) The exact effects of these augmented functions are up to you and the group, but augmented body parts and functions are passively much stronger than usual and can be activated to drastically enhance their performance for a short time (usually 10 minutes or less)
Each augmented function can be activated once per mission. When you advance, you may take a new augmented function instead of the usual advancement rewards.

NECROBIONICIST: You never let a good body go to waste. With a reasonable amount of prep time, you can reanimate a fresh corpse to do your bidding using experimental technology. It is restored to MAX HP, and retains all traits or other abilities it had in life, but is otherwise (mostly) mindless. However, there is always one complication - roll 1D6 (1: It becomes hostile and aggressive, attacking everyone on sight. 2-5: It is visibly falling apart, losing 1 HP for each action taken. 6: It regains memories of its former self, and begs you to end its torment.) Unless you rolled a 1 or 6, you can always command your cyber-zombie to perform an action by rolling +TACTICAL.

NECROMANCER: Through ritual magic, you may animate and control undisturbed corpses within eyeshot without rolling the dice (but you cannot control more at once than your CREATIVE score, with the minimum being one). To determine the HP of a reanimated corpse, roll 2D6, take the lowest, and halve the result (rounding down) with the minimum being one. Undead cannot follow complex instructions, use tools, or act without direct necromantic oversight. Clear, simple orders like “follow me,” “wait here,” or “guard this” will always be followed, but more complex tasks will require a +CREATIVE roll. Note that the exact results of this roll may not always be immediately clear, at the referee's discretion.

The resurrected dead will have half of their MAX HP due to their decaying flesh, but +2 ARMOR at all times due to their inability to feel pain. The resurrected are capable of following simple commands, but are incapable of doing complicated tasks such as repairing a vehicle or hacking a computer.

NEMESIS: There’s someone out there you have been fighting against for your entire life, and you’re not about to let them win. Upon picking this trait, create another character sheet with an equal amount of traits and other bonuses as your current character and hand this sheet to the referee. This character advances when you do; describe who this character is and why you hold a grudge against them. Before the beginning of a mission, roll 1D6. There is an X-in-1D6 chance that your nemesis will be in the mission area and attempt to destroy you, with x equal to the amount of missions passed without your nemesis appearing. Your nemesis is like you, and whenever you or they would roll the dice to do something risky, you make an opposed roll to them and vice versa. Whenever you would deal fatal damage to your nemesis, there is a 3-in-1D6 chance that they survive the encounter and retreat to fight another day. If you would kill your nemesis, you receive their traits, WAR DICE, and MAX HP. If you are able to reconcile and put your differences aside, they join your team and follow you into missions similar to the RECRUIT trait.

NON-EUCLIDEAN: You’ve realized that the physical world is not a flat surface, and is instead akin to a folded piece of paper with holes within it; You have learned to travel through these holes. You may create a fold in spacetime that allows you to pass from one physical point to another; this path will include hard to traverse geometry and entities that may be hostile towards interlopers. This fold may be accessed by anyone, but you may seal either end of the fold by rolling +CREATIVE. On a success, you close it without a hitch. On a partial success, spacetime will experience a minor rupture, and everyone inside will experience some adverse effect until they leave.

On a full success, their CHOKE score is also reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1, and they are discouraged from attacking you.

QUEST: You’re a chosen hero who does the same things over and over again for slightly better equipment. On taking this trait and after each mission, the ref will give you a quest for your next mission and decide on an associated reward. You choose the difficulty: easy quests (e.g. ‘kill 4 enemy grunts’) grant rewards like a grenade, a healing potion or a one use consumable. Medium quests (e.g. ‘Solve the mystery of a civilian’s disappearance’) grant rewards like armor, weapon tags or a meeting with a helpful NPC. Hard quests (e.g. ‘Kill a dragon on one-on-one combat’) grant rewards like unique collectibles, a free advance or an opportunity to fight a boss you shouldn’t be able to yet.

 RADAR: You don’t get lost easily- you just backtrack. You have a radar system in your vision that provides a top-down wireframe view of your immediate surroundings, and also has icons showing the locations of three specific things- write them on your sheet when you take this trait (such as medical items, CROs, land vehicles, gun parts, dimensional rifts, or predatory animals). These icons may get bigger and less precise if something’s particularly well-hidden, but they’ll always give you some idea of its physical location and move with their corresponding thing. Your tracking beacon creates a secondary radar map of the area surrounding it on use, which you can always view until the end of the mission. When you advance, you may add three more types of icon to your radar instead of taking one of the usual advancement options.

REMOTE: Your physical body is stowed away somewhere safe as you psychically control an artificial body for combat. This artificial body uses your other traits and grants you an extra 1D6 MAX HP or 1D6 WAR DICE alongside another chosen option upon character advancement. Whenever this artificial body is reduced to 0 HP, the body must be extracted from the mission for repairs or you will have to craft another one, rendering your character unable to insert until the end of the next mission.

The referee will describe your new current situation, and each player can describe a flashback to a moment that was skipped.

SOLIPSIST: You are the only thing that truly exists. Everything else exists only because you are thinking about it. While considering the ramifications of this philosophy, you have become entangled in it; once per mission, if you are able to meditate uninterrupted for about a minute, something you have previously perceived not only stops existing, but it never existed to begin with. When you do this, you also erase something from your character sheet.

STANCES: You have the ability to swap between stances. For each of the 4 attributes (FRC, TAC, CRE, and RFX), come up with a name and an action that places you in a stance—perhaps you completely clear your mind to enter Athena Stance (TAC), or your body bursts into flames when you enter Lion Stance (FRC). You may enter any stance at any time, and cannot be in more than one stance simultaneously. While in a stance, you have +3 to rolls for the attribute that the stance corresponds to, and -3 to rolls for any other attribute.

The first time you reach 0 HP during a mission, you transform into your horrifying, true eldritch form, fully healing to MAX HP and destroying any armor on yourself. You don’t abide by conventions - in your eldritch form, you can’t spend WAR DICE, and instead add 1D4 to all rolls made to attack, use supernatural abilities or inspire maddening terror; subtracting 1D4 from all rolls made to do anything else. You revert to your mortal self at the end of the mission. You can choose to enter your eldritch form early by spending a WAR DIE.

STICK: You’re a living stick figure, drawn to the possibility of doing incredibly badass things. Whenever you resolve a roll, gain the listed amount of STYLE POINTS and mark down your total somewhere on your sheet (failure: 3, partial success: 2, full success: 1, ultra success: 4). You may spend the listed amounts of style points for the following effects:
2: increase an instance of damage you deal by 1, up to three times per instance.
4: ALL dice you make during and resulting from your next roll explode (see FIST: Ultra Edition p.73).
8: produce a relevant item for an immediate challenge from out of nowhere- it will have a complication of the ref’s choice, and vanish instantly after use.
10: gain a trait (but not its item or stat bonus) during your next roll, then immediately lose it.
16: roll an ULTRA SUCCESS automatically, but receive no STYLE POINTS for it.
You cannot speak, but may gesture to communicate with others- close allies will typically have an easier time understanding specific meanings. If you spot an important-looking enemy stick figure, you and the ref are honour-bound to ensure that the coolest possible fight between you and them happens.

SQUAD: you’re a squad of mooks who have fallen in with some hero types. each mook has 1 HP and questionable aim, so you’re only capable of dealing damage to a target when you focus fire. mooks also have to work in concert to use Traits (e.g., Safecracker, Pyromaniac). give each mook a name; the shorter and fewer syllables the better (e.g., Chief, Doc, Z). you do not regain HP from healing, but so long as one mook survives a mission, your HP returns to maximum between missions as new mooks are recruited. mooks can function independently outside of combat or using Traits, but all independent rolls are made without attribute bonuses, unless the attribute is negative.

TWIST: You are hiding an alter ego. Once per mission, you can reveal your second persona, causing all of your attributes to invert for the rest of the mission (for example, +2 becomes -2 and -1 becomes +1). They revert back to normal after the mission ends. If you reveal it in front of enemies, the pure shock causes them to halt whatever they’re doing for a brief moment.

ULTRAVOID: You can make grenades that conjure miniature, momentary black holes. Anything near the grenade when it detonates is instantly obliterated, and all other objects are pulled towards it at high speeds. All player characters within pulling range (including you) have to roll +REFLEXIVE or +FORCEFUL (character’s choice). On a success, they are able to keep themselves stable; on a partial success, they are thrown at breakneck speeds in a random direction after the black hole dissipates; on a failure, they are also pulled in and obliterated.
* Black hole grenade (two uses), +1 REFLEXIVE

ULTRAKILL: Blood is fuel, Hell is full. You are capable of absorbing the blood of your enemies and converting it into health. Any time you deal DAMAGE in close proximity to an enemy, you heal the amount of DAMAGE dealt as HP. You may also overheal and temporarily add extra HP equal to your MAX HP. However, you cannot be healed by any other means, and you will die if you do not become drenched in blood before the end of the mission.

[AUTHOR: Groov]

UNCONSCIOUS: You have driven a stake into your third eye and live without thought nor presence. Others must make an active and exerted effort to perceive your existence, similar to breathing manually. If one has not been informed of your existence, they cannot perceive you and cannot physically affect you in any tangible way. You do not think, ever. Your mind cannot be read or manipulated. As you lack thought, you do not think before acting; when you gain a WAR DIE, you immediately use it on the next check you make. When you gain something which is of limited use, such as a consumable, you immediately use it. You have no traits besides UNCONSCIOUS, but during a mission, as many times as you'd like, you may randomly roll a trait. If it has a "once per mission" ability or consumable/limited use item, you must immediately trigger it and gain the trait for the remainder of the mission. When you do anything, you can never "take it back" retroactively (unless for genuine safety reasons).

UNRAVEL: You've seen between the lines and can pull the very strands on the world, if you try hard enough. Once per active combat, you may decrease your MAX HP by 2 to destabilize the strings keeping a target of your choice together.

This lasts until they die, their body fizzling into nothing once they do so. You regain all MAX HP lost this way at the end of the mission.

If you advance, you may gain an ability associated with another organ, instead of taking the usual advancement reward.

On a failure, it’s too difficult to copy and you regain your use of this ability, but can never use it on the same target again. On a partial success, you can say 1D6 sentences before you lose the knack of copying it. On a full success, you can copy it until the end of the mission. On an ultra success, you can copy it indefinitely.

WAVEDREAMER: You sometimes receive information from a source you don’t fully understand. At the start of a mission roll +CRE and record the total. When any player rolls dice and ends with that roll’s total equal to your total, the referee will tell you a yet unknown piece of information about your current situation as a waking dream, bizarre instinct, or another voice in your head. If your initial total is 0 or lower, the information you gain is a cognitohazard, and psychically causes 1 DAMAGE to anyone who hears it for the first time, including yourself.

WEAPONBOUND: You are bonded to an enchanted weapon. If the weapon is not in your hands, you may call it to you and it will attempt to fly back to you in a direct line at its terminal velocity, with the commensurate penetrative/concussive power.

WICK: There is a flame inside of you. It burns brightly, but burns fast. In order to keep it fueled, you have to eat quite a bit more than the average person, along with making sure to stay dry.

While at 1 HP, any damage you take has a 1-in-D6 chance of putting out the flame, and the chance increases by 1 every time your flame survives.

WORMLORD: You can transform into a writhing swarm of worms at will. While in this form, you gain +1 REFLEXIVE, and can squeeze through narrow gaps as well as burrow through soil in a matter of seconds, but all attacks you make are one degree of success lower. If you drop to 0 HP in any form, you can choose to disperse your swarm, temporarily taking you out of the mission.

WORLDTHIEF: Your many interdimensional travels across the eons of your existence have coalesced into a marvelous collection of odd trinkets. once per session you may reach into your cosmic fanny pack and pull out a single-use object that, when activated, will solve one specific though small problem, like a gap too wide to jump, a van that’s run out of gas, a locked sewer grate, or a precariously- perched piece of unexploded ordnance. When you tire of this world, you will leave it the same way you entered: a portal made from your magic blood.

        1. Your worst work (explodes 5 seconds after it’s drawn for 3 DAMAGE) 
        2. Your weird phase (1 DAMAGE, applies a bizarre and highly situational debuff) 
        3. Your first design (1 DAMAGE, holds sentimental value)

        5. Your bread and butter (1D6+1 DAMAGE)

At any time, you may expend a WAR DIE to reach into the bag and roll again. Weapons grabbed already are not removed from the list.
