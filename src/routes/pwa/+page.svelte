	<h1>P.W.A. Info</h1>
	<p>
		FIST Ref is now a P.W.A., or Progressive Web Application. It still works completely as a normal
		website, but with a few benefits. Data is stored locally on your device, and things should be
		much snappier after the initial load. This also saves data by not repeatedly requesting it from
		the server.
	</p>
	<p>
		It also allows offline usage, which should help those of you playing FIST in basements or on
		abandoned oil rigs.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also now install it to use as a desktop or mobile app, if you want a dedicated window
		without the browser UI.
	</p>
	<p><b>DESKTOP:</b> Use the install icon in the address bar.</p>
	<p>
		<b>ANDROID CHROME:</b> Using the 3-dot menu in the top right corner, select "Add to Home Screen"
		or "Install app"
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>iOS:</b> Tap the Share button (the square with an arrow pointing up). Select "Add to Home Screen".
		Perhaps CYCLOPS is behind this user experience.
